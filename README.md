### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Kyle Seneker** and I'm currently working as an **Engineering Manager @ HashiCorp**. Earlier in my career, I worked as a full-stack engineer using Java, C#, Ruby, Python, and Go, and primarily focused on building infrastructure automation solutions for my previous employer. In 2017, I changed the direction of my career and moved into Engineering leadership and truly believe I have found what I enjoy to do - leading people and helping them to succeed and grow!

In my spare time I enjoy coding in Go, Ruby, and Python, and have recently started diving into Assembly and related technologies with a goal of furthering my understanding of the underlying components of the technology we use every day.
