### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I lead runtime infrastructure at HashiCorpâ€”but this space is for the deeper stuff: the systems I break, rebuild, and reverse-engineer to actually understand whatâ€™s going on under the hood.

Iâ€™m into infrastructure at every layerâ€”from global compute orchestration down to the instruction set. Iâ€™ve built tools that schedule workloads, automate infrastructure, and keep platforms resilient across regions. But what I really care about is how all of it fits togetherâ€”why things fail, what abstractions leak, and how bits become behavior.

These days, I still write a lot of Go, Ruby, and Python. I build CLI tooling, test frameworks, and automation pipelines that (hopefully) make systems safer to operate. On the side, Iâ€™ve been digging into Assembly, syscalls, and instruction-level behaviorâ€”because if Iâ€™m going to run distributed platforms, I want to understand what happens from silicon to SLO.
